## Introduction

Every year FIFA releases a new game that complies player data from every player in the league. When viewing the data in the game, everything makes sense when viewing the data. However, if we extract this data from the game and try to perform analysis on it. There is a need for data cleaning. This project will clean data from FIFA 21 and prepare it for analysis.

The dataset that we will be using was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring?select=fifa21_raw_data.csv%E2%80%8B), the file that we used was v2. It can also be accessed in this repository [here](https://github.com/jidafan/FIFA-Data-Cleaning/blob/main/fifa21%20raw%20data%20v2.csv).

## Data Cleaning

In this project, we will be almost exclusively cleaning the data. This includes removing unnecessary columns, fixing the data types of columns, renaming columns, removing characters from variables/columns, and creating new columns. 

The code for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jidafan/FIFA-Data-Cleaning/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)
